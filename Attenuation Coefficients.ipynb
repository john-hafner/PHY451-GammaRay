    "### Question: Formula for the mass attenuation coefficient for lead\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there is a formula for the mass attenuation coefficient of lead as a function of photon energy. The mass attenuation coefficient is a material-specific property that describes how well a material attenuates radiation per unit mass. It is typically denoted by the symbol $\\mu/\\rho$ and has units of cm$^2$/g.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the mass attenuation coefficient of lead as a function of photon energy can be derived from the cross-section data for lead, which is available in various databases such as NIST XCOM, IAEA EXFOR, and ENDF/B-VII. The cross-section data provides the probability of a photon being scattered or absorbed by an atom in the material as a function of photon energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One commonly used formula for the mass attenuation coefficient of lead as a function of photon energy is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho} = A \\cdot \\frac{Z + 1}{Z} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^3}{(1 + \\lambda)^3} \\cdot \\left[1 + \\frac{a_1}{1 + a_2 \\cdot (\\lambda)^{a_3}}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the photon wavelength in angstroms, $Z$ is the atomic number of the material, and $A$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ are material-specific parameters that are determined from experimental cross-section data. For lead, the values of these parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = 45.98$ cm$^2$/g\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_1 = 0.6624$\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_2 = 3.510 \\times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{3.739}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_3 = 1.213$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is valid for photon energies between 1 keV and 100 GeV. It is worth noting that there are other formulas and tabulated data available in the literature that can be used to calculate the mass attenuation coefficient of lead as a function of photon energy."

    "## Question: Can you give me the same answer for the linear attenuation coefficient of lead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I can provide the formula for the linear attenuation coefficient of lead as a function of photon energy. The linear attenuation coefficient is a material-specific property that describes how much a material attenuates radiation per unit length. It is typically denoted by the symbol $\\mu$ and has units of cm$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the linear attenuation coefficient of lead as a function of photon energy can be derived from the mass attenuation coefficient formula and the density of lead, which is approximately 11.34 g/cm$^3$ at room temperature. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\frac{\\mu/\\rho}{\\rho} = \\frac{A \\cdot \\frac{Z + 1}{Z} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^3}{(1 + \\lambda)^3} \\cdot \\left[1 + \\frac{a_1}{1 + a_2 \\cdot (\\lambda)^{a_3}}\\right]}{\\rho}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the photon wavelength in angstroms, $Z$ is the atomic number of the material, $A$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ are material-specific parameters, and $\\rho$ is the density of the material. For lead, the values of these parameters and the density are the same as in my previous answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that there are also other formulas and tabulated data available in the literature that can be used to calculate the linear attenuation coefficient of lead as a function of photon energy."
