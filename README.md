# PHY451-GammaRay
Covering the gamma ray spectroscopy analysis for our first experiment in PHY 451.  
There's data we collect on the impact of adding lead or aluminum shielding to the 
setup, as well as peak information & energy to channel data.  Everything should
be in the \data folder for that, and then the main directory houses a few python
notebooks that make use of the data & can be loaded in whatever notebook app you want.
